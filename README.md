## üß† Model

This project uses the YOLOv11 object detection model. The model architecture consists of:

*   A backbone for feature extraction
*   A neck for feature fusion
*   A head for object detection

The pre-trained model is fine-tuned on the VisDrone dataset for aerial object detection.

## üìä Dataset

The model was trained on the [VisDrone dataset](https://github.com/VisDrone/VisDrone-Dataset), which contains images and annotations for various object categories.
