# Integrating Raspberry Pi Zero with MAVProxy and Mission Planner

## Step 1: Set Up Your Raspberry Pi

1. **Install the Operating System:**
   - If you haven't already, install Raspberry Pi OS on your Raspberry Pi Zero. You can use Raspberry Pi Imager or another tool to flash the OS onto an SD card.

2. **Connect Your Raspberry Pi to the Internet:**
   - Use either Wi-Fi (if using Raspberry Pi Zero W) or a USB-to-Ethernet adapter to connect your Raspberry Pi to the internet.

3. **Update Your Raspberry Pi:**
   - Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi (or SSH into it if you're using headless mode) and run:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get upgrade -y
     ```

## Step 2: Install MAVProxy

1. **Install Python and Pip:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed. Install `pip` (Python's package installer) if it's not already installed:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-dev -y
     ```

2. **Install MAVProxy:**
   - Install MAVProxy using `pip`:
     ```bash
     pip3 install MAVProxy
     ```
   - Verify the installation by running:
     ```bash
     mavproxy.py --version
     ```
   - You should see the version number of MAVProxy, confirming the installation was successful.

## Step 3: Set Up Serial Communication

1. **Enable Serial Port:**
   - Open the Raspberry Pi configuration tool:
     ```bash
     sudo raspi-config
     ```
   - Navigate to **Interfacing Options** > **Serial**.
   - Disable the shell login over serial and enable the serial hardware.
   - Reboot the Raspberry Pi to apply the changes:
     ```bash
     sudo reboot
     ```

2. **Identify the Serial Device:**
   - After rebooting, identify the serial device (it’s usually `/dev/serial0` for the Raspberry Pi’s GPIO serial):
     ```bash
     ls -l /dev
     ```
   - Look for `serial0` or `ttyAMA0`.

## Step 4: Configure MAVProxy to Work with Mission Planner

1. **Start MAVProxy:**
   - Run the following command to start MAVProxy on the Raspberry Pi, specifying the correct serial port and baud rate (57600 is a common baud rate for telemetry modules):
     ```bash
     mavproxy.py --master=/dev/serial0 --baudrate 57600 --out=udp:YOUR_GCS_IP:14550
     ```
   - Replace `/dev/serial0` with the appropriate serial device if it's different.
   - Replace `YOUR_GCS_IP` with the IP address of the computer running Mission Planner.

   This command tells MAVProxy to:
   - Connect to the flight controller via the specified serial port and baud rate.
   - Forward MAVLink data to Mission Planner over UDP on port `14550`.

2. **MAVProxy Command Line:**
   - Once MAVProxy starts, you’ll see a command line interface. This CLI allows you to issue commands to MAVProxy directly.

3. **Test the Connection:**
   - In the MAVProxy CLI, type:
     ```bash
     status
     ```
   - You should see the status of the connection and the messages being exchanged with the flight controller.

## Step 5: Set Up Mission Planner on the Ground Control Station

1. **Download and Install Mission Planner:**
   - If you haven’t already, download and install Mission Planner on your Windows PC from [here](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-installation.html).

2. **Connect Mission Planner to MAVProxy:**
   - Open Mission Planner.
   - Go to the **"Connect"** tab at the top-left corner.
   - Select **UDP** as the connection method.
   - Enter `14550` (or the port number you used in the MAVProxy command) in the port field.
   - Click **"Connect"**.

3. **Monitor the Connection:**
   - If everything is set up correctly, you should see the telemetry data from the Raspberry Pi (via MAVProxy) appearing in Mission Planner.
   - You can now use Mission Planner to send commands, set waypoints, and control your drone.

## Step 6: Automating MAVProxy Start on Boot (Optional)

1. **Create a Shell Script:**
   - Create a new script file:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /home/pi/start_mavproxy.sh
     ```
   - Add the following content:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     mavproxy.py --master=/dev/serial0 --baudrate 57600 --out=udp:YOUR_GCS_IP:14550
     ```
   - Save and exit the file (`Ctrl + X`, `Y`, `Enter`).

2. **Make the Script Executable:**
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     sudo chmod +x /home/pi/start_mavproxy.sh
     ```

3. **Set Up Cron Job:**
   - Open the crontab file:
     ```bash
     crontab -e
     ```
   - Add the following line to the end of the file:
     ```bash
     @reboot /home/pi/start_mavproxy.sh &
     ```
   - Save and exit the crontab file.

4. **Reboot the Raspberry Pi:**
   - The MAVProxy should now start automatically on boot and connect to Mission Planner.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Ensure Correct IP Address:** Verify that the IP address in the MAVProxy command matches the IP of the computer running Mission Planner.
- **Firewall:** Ensure that there’s no firewall blocking UDP traffic on port `14550`.
- **Check Serial Connection:** Ensure that the flight controller is correctly connected to the Raspberry Pi and that the serial device (`/dev/serial0`) is correctly identified.

---

Following these steps should get you up and running with MAVProxy on your Raspberry Pi, integrated with Mission Planner for controlling and monitoring your drone.
