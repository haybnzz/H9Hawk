# ESP Aerial Object Detection

This project contains the code for an aerial object detection system designed to run on an ESP32-based drone.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to:

1.  Set up your ESP32 development environment.
2.  Install the necessary libraries (e.g., TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers).
3.  Flash the firmware to your ESP32.

## Usage

The `object_detection.py` file contains the main logic for detecting objects. You will need to modify this file to implement your specific object detection model.
